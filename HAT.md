 ENGINEERING SPECIFICATION — Hat-Integrated Single-Cup Audio System (Rev. 1.0)

Project Codename: Hybrid SoftShell Audio Hat w/ CH720N Integration
Designed For: Over-ear cup pocket + ear-flap mounted boom mic
Prepared For: Eric Lindau

1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

A cold-weather SoftShell + leather hybrid hat integrating:

Sony WH-CH720N single earpiece (modified single-cup configuration)

SoftShell ear-flap audio pocket

Wireless electret boom microphone mounted on TPE cable

Double-layer SoftShell housing

Premium leather crown + bill components

The system must operate passively as a hat and actively as a Bluetooth audio device with 2.4 GHz internal mic link.

Bend radius: ≥ 8 mm

Temperature tolerance: -20°C → +50°C

UV resistance: Class 4

Semi-rigid to avoid flapping

5. ELECTRONICS & WIRELESS SYSTEM
Audio System Split:

Mic → Headphone

Protocol: 2.4 GHz low-latency audio link

Purpose: bypass Bluetooth mic quality limits

Headphone → Phone

Standard Bluetooth 5.2

Profile: A2DP + HFP

Drivers:

Circular stitch reinforcement top + bottom

Pocket depth to be maintained using spacer ring during sewing

Spacer thickness: 1.45 in

7.4 Electronics Integration

Mic cable sewn into neoprene edge with hidden anchor stitch

Headphone cup inserted post-manufacture via access zipper (hidden seam)

8. QUALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENTS
Test	Requirement	Pass Condition
Acoustic leakage test	Cup fit	<15% leakage
Wind tunnel test	Mic stabilizes	Oscillation <2°
